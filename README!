This project was made in less than 5 weeks, so the final parts of the game (the result display) was not implemented very cleanly. Also, the code was not properly documented, and this is something we aim to achieve as soon as we congregate together to complete this app and release it on the App Store, which due to the class scheduling of the members on this project is inconvenient this academic quarter.
